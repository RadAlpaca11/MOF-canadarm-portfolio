# Museum of Flight Internship: CANADARM living history activity

## Description
Creating a living history activity at the Museum of Flight to engage visitors to learn about the CANADARM and the Mission Specialist astronaut role.

## Final product


## The need
This project was created when I noticed that museum visitors would often not notice the CANADARM model on the Space Shuttle Full Fuselage Trainer (FFT) at the museum. This bummed me out because I think that it is a fascinating part of the space shuttle, and want everyone to know about it!

## Approach
I wanted to make sure that the activity was fun and interactive, as I think that greatly increases the value of the experience, allowing this activity to educate more people of all ages. 


## Prototyping
When talking with the museum staff and volunteers, I discovered that they had some grabber arms, and I saw the amazing opportunity to use them for the activity. 



### Misc content that has nowhere to go, yet...
During research, I decided to incorporate the role of Mission Specialiast into the activity, because it is an important astronaut role. 

The FFT was what all the astronauts would train in before going on a mission in the space shuttle, and it has a wooden mock-up of the CANADARM where it would be located in the payload bay. The arm is a wooden model, as the actual arm could not hold it's own weight in earth's gravity.
