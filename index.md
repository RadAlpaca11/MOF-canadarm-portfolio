# Museum of Flight Internship: CANADARM living history activity

## Description
Creating a living history activity at the [Museum of Flight](https://museumofflight.org), in Seattle, WA, to engage visitors to learn about the CANADARM (the robotic arm used to deploy, manipulate, and retrieve payload and astronauts) and the Mission Specialist astronaut role on the Space Shuttle missions. 

## Final product
include document and pictures
include pictures of graphic, and earlier pictures of graphic drafts as well


## The need
As a volunteer at the museum, I was stationed at the Space Shuttle Full Fuselage Trainer, to answer any questions museum visitors had. One of my favorite features of the Space Shuttle is the CANADARM, not surprising since I am so interested in robotics.  However, I noticed that museum visitors would often walk through the FFT exhibit and not even notice this incredible feat of engineering.  I wanted to change that. I wanted everyone to learn about the CANADARM because I think it is a fascinating part of the space shuttle.


## The approach
To make sure people engaged with this activity and learned about the CANADARM, the activity had to be fun and interactive. It was also important to me that the activity would appeal to people of all ages - especially younger children since they make up so many of the museum's visitors.



## Prototyping
When talking with the museum staff and volunteers, I discovered that they had some grabber arms, and I saw the amazing opportunity to use them for the activity.
The activity started out very simple, scattering objects around on the ground, and a bin that they would have to drop the objects in using the arm.
Over time it evolved. First with decorating the bin to look like the space shuttle, so that they were retrieving objects from space, into the payload bay.
This helped to connect what visitors were doing, to the actual space shuttle. 
The next thing was making a graphic to go along with the activity.
A draft was made, printed, and laminated to test it out, and it was a huge success.
It gave the activity more structure, connection to the space shuttle, and generated more interest, since it looked pretty cool.
After the success with the draft, I was able to meet with the Graphics Team at the museum, who would be able to make a real graphic to use with the activity.



### Misc content that has nowhere to go, yet...
During research, I decided to incorporate the role of Mission Specialiast into the activity, because it is an important astronaut role. 

The FFT was what all the astronauts would train in before going on a mission in the space shuttle, and it has a wooden mock-up of the CANADARM where it would be located in the payload bay. The arm is a wooden model, as the actual arm could not hold it's own weight in earth's gravity.
