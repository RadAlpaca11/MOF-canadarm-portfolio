# Museum of Flight Internship: CANADARM living history activity

## Description
Creating a living history activity at the [Museum of Flight](https://museumofflight.org){:target="_blank"}, in Seattle, WA, to engage visitors in learning about:
- The CANADARM: The robotic arm used to deploy, manipulate, and retrieve payloads and astronauts.
- The Mission Specialist astronaut role on Space Shuttle missions.


## Final product
The final product for this project was a complete [training document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9AUOT_0niWfjY-ggKWS2YEaCSL5oKohqTKED0P7zqQ/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} so that other museum volunteers could run this activity, even after I had completed my internship.
It was my hope that this activity would continue to educate museum visitors in the future.
I recently heard from the volunteer coordinator at the museum that a new volunteer is now running the activity.

## The need
As a volunteer at the museum, I was stationed at the Space Shuttle Full Fuselage Trainer (FFT) to answer any questions museum visitors had. One of my favorite features of the Space Shuttle is the CANADARM, not surprising since I am so interested in robotics. However, I noticed that museum visitors would often walk through the FFT exhibit without noticing this incredible feat of engineering. I wanted to change that. I wanted everyone to learn about the CANADARM because I think it is a fascinating part of the Space Shuttle.


## The approach
To make sure people engaged with this activity and learned about the CANADARM, the activity needed to be fun and interactive. It was also important to me that the activity appealed to people of all ages - especially younger children since they make up so many of the museum's visitors.


## Prototyping
During discussions with museum staff and volunteers, I discovered they had some grabber arms available, and I saw an amazing opportunity to use them for the new activity. The initial concept was straightforward: objects were scattered on the ground, and visitors used the arm to pick them up and drop them into a bin. Over time, the activity evolved. The first enhancement involved decorating the bin to resemble the Space Shuttle, transforming the task into retrieving objects from "space" into the payload bay. This modification helped visitors connect their actions to actual Space Shuttle operations.
The next improvement was creating an accompanying graphic. We started with a draft version, which was printed and laminated for testing. This addition was a huge success. It provided more structure to the activity, strengthened the connection to the Space Shuttle, and generated greater interest among visitors due to its visual appeal. Encouraged by the draft's positive reception, I had a meeting with the museum's Graphics Team to discuss the creation of a professional-quality graphic for long-term use with the activity.

### Misc content that has nowhere to go, yet...
During research, I decided to incorporate the role of Mission Specialiast into the activity, because it is an important astronaut role. 

The FFT was what all the astronauts would train in before going on a mission in the space shuttle, and it has a wooden mock-up of the CANADARM where it would be located in the payload bay. The arm is a wooden model, as the actual arm could not hold it's own weight in earth's gravity.
